    Why is this book good for new teachers?
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p style='font-size:2em;'>I loved my education. I look back fondly on the time I spent in the classes I took and remember the excitement had in my journey to become a teacher. 
    However, what I didn't learn was how real the kids and the problems they bring are when I entered the class room. One of the reasons I wrote this book was
    to prepare teachers to the fact that the students and their lives are much more real than they seem when they are learning to become a teacher.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="title">
    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
    Is this a children's book?
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p style='font-size:2em;'>It is more a story about children, but I've learned many parents have read the stories with their children. What they found is that the children are 
    interested in learning more about the lives of the other children. Finding ways to empathize with children that may not have what they have or grew up with 
    different problems than they have. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="title">
    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
    What is in this book for me?
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p style='font-size:2em;'>When I decided to put this book together, I thought back about the children I connected with through my 25 years of teaching. What I realized was, I came to know and remember the kids most through
    the stories from home that they brought with them. Which, I think is what leads to becoming a successful teacher. My hope is that the teachers that read this book find ways to connect more with their 
    students and are able to become more effective as a result.
